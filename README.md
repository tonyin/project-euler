projecteuler
============

Author: Tony Yin

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) solutions implemented in R. Each problem/solution resides in its own file and contains the problem prompt, optional input for a more generalized problem (eg. use a different number), and program running time info.

### Things still need to implement:

* p7 - sieve of erastothenes
* p9 - euclid's formula
* p14 - 183s. need a heuristic
